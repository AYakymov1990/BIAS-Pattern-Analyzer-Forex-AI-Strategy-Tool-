Built an AI-powered tool in Python that uses an LLM to analyze financial market data and generate forecasts based
on predefined trading patterns. This project showcases the ability to apply LLMs for complex analytical tasks.
•LLM for Analysis: Utilized a GPT-3.5-turbo model to perform analysis and generate forecasts.
•Prompt Engineering: Engineered complex prompts to encapsulate business logic and guide the LLM's analytical
process.
•Automated Data Pipeline: Created an automated pipeline for ingesting and processing multi-timeframe market
data from financial APIs using Pandas.
